This is a simple TCP-based FTP (File Transfer Protocol) implementation where a client can send a file to a server over a reliable TCP connection. The client selects a file, sends its name to the server, and then transmits the file's contents in chunks. The server receives the file name, creates a new file, and writes the incoming data to it. The communication is error-handled, ensuring smooth data transfer. Once the transfer is complete, the client signals the server, and both close their connections. This setup demonstrates basic file sharing over a network using sockets in C.
